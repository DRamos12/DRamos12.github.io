title: Merge Sort
---

This week I am covering a popular sorting algorithm - merge sort. Merge sort is a comparison based sorting algorithm. It works as follows

1. Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element

2. Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.

This can be implemented using either a recursive ("top-down") or an iterative ("bottom-up") approach. We will be using the recursive top-down approach in this example.

    //Split the input array in half
     [4, 7, 4, 3, 9, 1, 2] -> [4, 7, 4], [3, 9, 1, 2

    //Both sides are sorted recursively:
     [4, 7, 4] -> [4, 4, 7]
     [3, 9, 1, 2] -> [1, 2, 3, 9]

    //Both halves are merged:
     [4, 7, 4], [3, 9, 1, 2] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7, 9]

    //Return the sorted array
     [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7, 9]

Now we we will write the code for merge sort.

     var mergeSort = function(arr) {

       // break down the array until there's only one element left
       if (!Array.isArray(arr)|| arr.length < 2) {
         return arr;
       }
     ​
       // Split the array into two halves.
       var left = array.slice(0, Math.floor(array.length / 2););
       var right = array.slice(Math.floor(array.length / 2););

       ​function merge(left, right) {
          var result = [];

         //for as long as there are elements in either left or right, iterate
         while (left.length && right.length) {
           if (left[0] <= right[0]) {
               result.push(left.shift());
           } else {
               result.push(right.shift());
           }
         }

         while (left.length)
            result.push(left.shift());

         while (right.length)
            result.push(right.shift());

         return result;
      }
       return merge(mergeSort(left), mergeSort(right));
    };

And there you have the it, the merge function does most of the wrok!
